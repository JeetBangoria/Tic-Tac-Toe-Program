# Tic-Tac-Toe-Program

Tic Tac Toe is a very classic game which involves two players ‘X’ and ‘O’. The 
tactic of the game is that one of the player chooses one symbol and fills up one 
of the cells of a 3x3 grid. The other player respectively does the same with the 
other symbol. During the progression of the game, the player must try to make 
a move such that he has on whole row/column/diagonal filled with his
respective characters ‘X’ or ‘O’. If no player wins, then the game is a tie. 
Various patterns have been developed to master this game.
